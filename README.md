## Error Handling

If an error occurs during scraping, it will be thrown as an exception. Use `try/catch` to handle errors gracefully.

Example:
```javascript
try {
  const data = await SocialScrapper.whatsapp("5511000000000");
  console.log(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error:", error.message);
}
```

---

## Roadmap

- Add support for Instagram profiles.
- Implement robust error handling and proxy support.
